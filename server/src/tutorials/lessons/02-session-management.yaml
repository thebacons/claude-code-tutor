      text: "Welcome back! In this lesson, we'll explore session management in Claude Code. You'll learn how to continue conversations, resume old sessions, and even fork your session history. These features are essential for maintaining context across coding sessions."

      speaker: Elisabeth
      text: "Every time you interact with Claude Code, your conversation is saved as a session. Sessions have unique IDs and store the full context of your discussion. This means you can pick up exactly where you left off, even days later."

  - id: continue-demo
    type: demo
    voice:
      speaker: Elisabeth
      text: "The simplest way to continue working is with the dash c flag. This picks up your most recent conversation. Let me show you the command."
    terminal:
      command: "echo 'Command: claude -c  (continues most recent session)'"
      demo: true
      demoDelay: 70
    onSuccess: "The dash c flag is your go-to option when you want to keep working on what you started earlier."

  - id: try-pwd
    type: interactive

      speaker: Elisabeth
      text: "Let's practice a quick command. Type 'pwd' to see your current working directory."
    validation:
      type: output-contains
      value: "/"
    hints:
      - "Type: pwd"
      - "pwd stands for 'print working directory'"
    onSuccess: "Your current directory is displayed. Claude Code always starts in a specific working directory."

  - id: resume-explain
    type: voice
    voice:
      speaker: Elisabeth
      text: "Sometimes you want to resume a specific session, not just the most recent one. The dash r flag opens an interactive picker showing your recent sessions. You can also provide a session ID directly to jump to a specific conversation."

  - id: resume-demo
    type: demo
    voice:
      speaker: Elisabeth
      text: "Here's how you would resume a session by ID. The session ID is a unique identifier that Claude Code assigns to each conversation."
    terminal:
      command: "echo 'Command: claude -r abc123  (resumes session with ID abc123)'"
      demo: true
      demoDelay: 65
    onSuccess: "When you know the exact session you want, providing the ID is the fastest way to resume."

  - id: fork-explain
    type: voice
    voice:
      speaker: Elisabeth
      text: "Here's a powerful feature: forking sessions. When you fork a session, you create a new branch from an existing conversation. This is perfect when you want to try a different approach without losing your original work."

  - id: fork-demo
    type: demo
    voice:
      speaker: Elisabeth
      text: "To fork a session, combine the resume flag with the fork-session flag. Watch the command structure."
    terminal:
      command: "echo 'Command: claude -r abc123 --fork-session'"
      demo: true
      demoDelay: 60
    onSuccess: "Forking creates a new session that starts with all the context from the original, but branches off independently."

  - id: try-ls
    type: interactive
    voice:
      speaker: Elisabeth
      text: "Let's try another command. Type 'ls' to list files in the current directory."
    validation:
      type: output-contains
      value: ""
    hints:
      - "Type: ls"
      - "ls lists directory contents"
    onSuccess: "You can see the files in your current directory. Claude Code can read and modify these files when you ask it to."

      text: "Hei there! You've mastered session management! You now know how to continue with dash c, resume specific sessions with dash r, and even fork sessions to try different approaches. These skills will make your Claude Code workflow much more efficient. Kjempe bra!"
