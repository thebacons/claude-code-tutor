      text: "Every time you interact with Claude Code, your conversation is saved as a session. Sessions have unique IDs and store the full context of your discussion. This means you can pick up exactly where you left off, even days later."

      speaker: Elisabeth
      text: "The simplest way to continue working is with the dash c flag. This picks up your most recent conversation. You don't need to remember any session ID - Claude Code automatically finds your last session."

      speaker: Elisabeth
      text: "Sometimes you want to resume a specific session, not just the most recent one. The dash r flag lets you resume any previous session. You can either use it without an argument to see a list, or provide a session ID directly."

    hints:
      - "Type: claude -r --help"
      - "The -r flag resumes a specific session"
      - "You can provide a session ID after -r"
    onSuccess: "When you know the exact session you want, providing the ID after dash r is the fastest way to resume."
