      text: "CLAUDE.md is a special markdown file that Claude Code reads automatically when you start a session. It contains project-specific instructions, coding standards, and context that helps Claude understand your codebase better. Think of it as a briefing document for your AI assistant."

      speaker: Elisabeth
      text: "CLAUDE.md files follow a hierarchy. First, Claude reads your global file from your home directory's dot claude folder. Then it reads the project-level file in your repository root. Finally, it can read directory-specific files for specialized contexts. This layered approach gives you flexible control."
